# Introduction to Information Processing

## The Input Process Output (IPO) model

An information processor or information processing system, as its name suggests, is a system which takes information (a sequence of enumerated states) in one form and processes (transforms) it into another form, e.g. to statistics, by an algorithmic process.

Such a system usually consists of three parts:
* Input
* Process
* Output

Sometimes, **storage** is considered to be part of an information processing system too.

A stored program is a program, or a sequence of commands, stored in electronic memory.

## Components of an information system
* Purposes
* Data
* Processes
* Technologies
* Personnel

## Information cycle
* Data collection
* Organisation
* Analysis
* Storage
* Processing
* Transmission
* Presentation

## Data & Information
* Data refers to unprocessed raw data.
* Data can be of different nature, such as image, audio, video and text.
* Information, on the other hand, are processed data.

## Information Age
It is often considered that we now live in information age, where, due to the digital revolution, information are at our disposal. However, due to the large amount of information we now receive, it is important to have information literacy, which is defined as the ability to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information for the issue or problem at hand.
