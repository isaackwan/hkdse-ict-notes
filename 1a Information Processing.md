# Introduction to Information Processing

An information processor or information processing system, as its name suggests, is a system which takes information (a sequence of enumerated states) in one form and processes (transforms) it into another form, e.g. to statistics, by an algorithmic process.

Such a system usually consists of three parts:
* Input
* Process
* Output

Sometimes, **storage** is considered to be part of an information processing system too.
