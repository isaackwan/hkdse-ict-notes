# A3. Data Representation
## Differences between analog and digital
![sample of digital data](http://www.centerpointaudio.com/Images/Analog-Digital%20frequency%20examples.png)

## The need for digital data
* Analogue data exist in the physical world. However, it is not easy to replicate.
* Example: replication of VHR tapes MUST lead to loss of quality
* Digital data is in binary formats - easy for computers to read and transmit

## Conversation of integers between different bases
* Binary numbers (2)
* Denary numbers (10)
* Hexadecimal numbers (16)
* They are representation of numbers in different ways
* Conversation can be done with the help of

	1. calculators
	2. short division
	3. expanded form of place value
	
* You may group sets of 4 bits into a hexadecimal number.

### The relationship between the number of bits and number of patterns/combinations
The maximum combinition of a n-bit number is 2^n (2 to the power of n)

### Representation of negative numbers
* Computers usually use two's complement, instead of using the negative sign, to represent a negative number:
* Two's complement may be calculated by:
	1. First changing the number into binary
	2. "Flip" the bits (i.e. 1->0, 0->1)
	3. Add 1 to the result

* The left most bit is known as most significant bit (MSB)
* Provided that an overflow error did not occur, if MSB = 1, then it is a negative number
* Else it is a positive number

## Addition and subtraction of binary numbers
* Addition and subtraction may be done with the help of a calculator - choose "base" mode for such operations.
* Additionally, one may also use hand calculation to evaluate the results.
* Basic rules are the same - use carry/borrow when needed.

## Overflow errors
* Overflow error happens when
	1. an application writes more bytes/bits than it was allocated
	2. the assigned bits is not enough for the result of arithmetic operations.

In this specific context, we shall look into case 2.

### When does overflow happen?
In simple terms, a computer allocates specific number of bits to store the result of an arithmetic operation. If the allocation is not sufficient to store the result, an overflow error would occur.

### What consequences will an overflow error lead to?
The consequences vary. However, it is usually either:

1. The computation goes on without noticing the error, leading to an incorrect result
2. It causes a fatal error and the program therefore crashes.

### How can I point out an overflow error?
For any arithmetic operation with a + b, an overflow error would satisfy BOTH conditions listed below:

1. a and b is of same sign (positive or negative)
2. the result is of an opposite sign.

## Character coding systems
* Also known as character encoding systems and character sets.
* An established "mapping" between human-readable characters and computer (binary) codes.
* The computer must support the character set to display characters correctly.
* The computer must select the character set used to save the file to display characters correctly.
* A character set usually supports 1 language in addition to English only
* Examples:
	1. Big5 (Traditional Chinese)
	2. GB2312 (Simplified Chinese)
* Exceptions:
* ASCII - English only
* Unicode - supports ~ 100 scripts

* If the charcter set used is not Unicode, the file size of a text size can be estimated as follows:
	* 1 English character = 1 byte
	* 1 Chinese character = 2 bytes

> ### The relationship between the number of bits and number of patterns/combinations and the number of bits each character set uses is highly related.
> For English, the number of unique characters is less than 100. Thefore, a 7-bit character set is sufficient already.
> For Chinese, the number of unique characters is way, way more than that of English. Therefore, a 2-byte encoding scheme has to be employed.


> ### What is the difference between Unicode, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32?
> * Unicode is an international standard for mapping of human-readable characters and computer (binary) codes.
> * Since unicode has a variable length (1 - 4 bytes), different methods must be employed to "signal" the length of each character
> * UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 are different schemes for representing Unicode characters.

## Digitisation of analogue signals
* Most digitisation of analogue signals happens in the "input" process of an operation.
* For example, you might type in words, scan a document, or take some videos.
* More details will be covered in the multimedia elective.
* Digitisation usually goes through two processes:
	1. Sampling
	2. Quantization

## Difference and conversion of file formats
* File formats are international standards for storing specific type of files. This ensures interoperability between different computers and software.
* Different file formats exist to store different types of files. However, even for a single type of file, there may be multiple formats to cater for different needs.
* For examples, JPG is a lossy picture format. It produces files of a smaller size. In contrast, PNG is a lossless picture format. It produces files of a larger size.
* More details will be covered in the multimedia elective.
* Below is a table showing common file types

Type of file | File format
------------ | -------------
Document | .txt, .rtf, .doc, .docx
Image | .bmp, .jpg, .gif, .tif, .png
Video | .avi, .mpg, .wmv, .mov, .rm, .mp4
